## Getting help

If you have questions, concerns, bug reports, etc, please file an issue in this repository's Issue Tracker.

## Getting involved

At this moment, the project is probably not in a state where there are obviouse places for anyone to get involved until the PoC has been completed.

The only key area which we know will need some focus will be on UX & theming as this will be limited by standard OOTB Bootstrap due to the current teams limitations in these areas.
